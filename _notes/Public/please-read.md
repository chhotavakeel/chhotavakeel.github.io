read a lot. then when you’re tired, read some more. read things you agree with and read things you don’t. sit with discomfort - it leads to growth. 

read books on our justice system - its successes and failures. read anita gets bail by arun shourie and also read the colonial constitution by arghya sengupta. read to kill a mockingbird. read zia mody’s book and read madhav khosla and gautam bhatia. 

if i can be slightly selfish, please also read the financial papers - mint is good. read the morning context. subscribe to money stuff. maybe read barbarians at the gate and the smartest guys in the room? 

_if you don’t like reading, why are you in law school?_
