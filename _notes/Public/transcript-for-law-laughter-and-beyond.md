_this is a rough transcript of an interview i did in 2023 for a podcast run by my law school._

## what drove you to pursue a career in corporate law?

you know, i honestly think that this is the first time i’m realising that i have in fact pursued a career in corporate law. in any case, it happened quite by accident - life really is what happens when you’re busy making other plans. i was always interested in litigating, and joined the disputes team at trilegal when i graduated. the partner i was working with then also took up electricity law disputes (which are before a specialised set of tribunals) and i found that body of law interesting enough to switch internally, full-time, into the transactional side of things. i was also extremely lucky to have found people who helped me immensely along this journey.

as to why i joined a firm, it was always seen as the ultimate culmination of the law school journey, and so i suppose that’s what i did - i think in law school, we have a tendency not to think what comes after that ppo or day zero placement. it took me some time to realise that your career is a marathon, and not a sprint.

to be honest, i find corporate law to be a little ’cleaner’ - by which, i mean it’s: (i) far swifter; and (ii) has room, at least in india, for far neater and cleverer drafting. that also appeals to me.

## how was your experience at nujs? what were some activities that allowed you to develop your skillset?

my experience at nujs was pretty great to be honest. in general, college gives you room to make mistakes and hopefully even learn from them. i tried my hand at all the typical law school activities - mooting, debating, and so on - it wasn’t until third year, or even later, that i realised i enjoyed adr competitions much much more. i had the chance to attend the hsf negotiation competition as a participant, and more recently, as a judge, and both were great experiences. in general, negotiation simulations simultaneously carry higher and lower stakes than actual negotiations, but they serve as useful shorthands for the real word.

_there's a beautiful [tweet](https://x.com/canpanicnow/status/1712634765147275493?s=61) says ”lawyers spend three years in law school just to learn to say "it depends." and you might wonder if that's time well-spent and all i can say is well, it depends on how you look at it.” - i suppose my law school experience was like that._

## how do you think legal education in india can be enhanced to meet the needs of students looking to become transactional lawyers?

that’s a hard question. i haven’t thought much about legal education since i graduated, and i remain sceptical about whether large-scale, systemic reform can be carried out so i’ll leave all talk of the socratic method out of this. that being said, i think the way law is taught, or at least how i was taught, was almost philosophical in the sense of how divorced it was from actual practice. 

this may also come up later, but the emphasis on being able to recite sections of statutes or landmark judgments from memory is rarely helpful in the real world - a-ha! moments where you know the exact precedent to apply to a problem are far rarer than you think. knowing how to apply the law in order to synthesise an answer for your client’s unique situation is a far more useful skill than simply knowing what the law says. and i don’t think we’re taught that.

which brings me to my answer - i think we need a lot more interaction with practising lawyers in law school than is currently done. i guess credit courses help bridge the gap to a certain extent - i would try and make them a more regular feature, by which i mean try and incentivise willing individuals to deliver the same course every year. a crash course on m&a for instance, or an introduction to energy law. i know some of these courses were run, but as one-off instances.

but as someone who does some degree of recruiting for my team - you really don’t need that as a fresher. that’s what we’re there for once you join us. there are some basic workplace expectations which need to be met, and the rest your seniors are meant to teach you.

## how do you think law students can find their interests? how did you find your interests?

exposure. as much as you can get of it. 

[[please read]].

if you must, watch some movies. Watch twelve angry men and watch gangajal. that cuts a fairly vast swathe across what you can expect to find in the profession.

next - intern. intern a lot. as much as you can, and in as many diverse places as possible. while i took every opportunity i got to intern, my one minor regret is that i didn’t diversify enough. 

also remember, everyone has interests - the aim is to find one that lets you earn a living. and there are more than enough instances of that - i know of people from law school who have gone on to become successful artists, sports lawyers, and even philosophy professors. 

i also feel like interests are somewhat of a virtuous cycle and that there’s a larger feedback loop at play. you’re interested in something -> you spend time on it -> you get better at it - you like doing it more. rinse and repeat.

as to how i found my interest, like i said, it was purely by accident. i had no idea what electricity law was when i was in law school. i, however, had a room overlooking the wbpdcl building - it was only after graduation did i figure out what the folks over there did when i had to submit a proposal to them.

_also, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpujfw4wtkw&pp=yguyyxjlihlvdsbkzxn0aw5lzcb0bybkzwfs) to figure out if being a transactional lawyer is for you._

## what is it like working as a projects lawyer? what kind of work and deliverables are there? how is the access to mentorship? is business development taught and carried out at an early stage? what tips do you have for those who want to work in this area? 

trust me, it’s pretty great, else i wouldn’t be able to do it for so long! 

our work is divided into three buckets:

(i) due diligences - you can’t avoid these as a firm lawyer, regardless of practice area. ours are specific to the infrastructure sector, be it ports, highways or renewable energy projects. we act both buy-side and sell-side - in either case, our job is to review contracts for the development and operation of these assets as well as for revenue generation from them, along with any approvals required for these activities. the purpose of a dd report is to highlight issues - inconsistencies, factual inaccuracies, etc., basis our review, and what we usually see in the market - these points serve as valuation drivers for the deal; <br>
(ii) contract drafting - we draft the contracts i mentioned under the previous bucket for greenfield projects being set up by our clients; and <br>
(iii) general advisory - again, this is pretty much unavoidable, as any kind of lawyer. if you’ve seen the godfather, then you’ll know your role here. as advertised on the cover, you’re expected to provide counsel to your client - hopefully, with lesser bloodshed. the infrastructure sector is also heavily regulated, with many authorities exercising oversight, so things, and interpretations of things, change multiple times a week - we’re expected to keep up with and opine on these.

on mentorship - given that it’s an area of law that requires some technical expertise, we all know and recognise that mentorship is required, and it’s fairly easy to come by. we’re a small community and are always very grateful when someone expresses an interest in joining us. business development is also a little easier, again, since it’s a small and close-knit community.

tips on those who want to work as projects lawyers - that’s a good one! i honestly don’t think there’s anything specific - i know legally india has a great list of books for projects lawyers, although i think i’ve only read one of them so your mileage may vary. i do think being a good lawyer is important. since today’s the world cup final, let’s put it this way - kohli isn’t a professional tennis player but i guarantee you he‘ll be a lot better at it than the average person. the same for goes for law - if you’re a good enough lawyer, a change in practice area won’t affect you too much. be up to speed with contract law, admin law, and interpretation of statutes - you’ll use these skills frequently, regardless of where you are or end up going. 

that being said, having good instincts as a lawyer is helpful (and that can be learnt), but all you really need is a keen eye for detail and to be willing to work hard and learn - it’s not rocket science! 

_not that rocket science is rocket science either - after all, we owe a great deal of our aviation history to amateurs working out of garages._

cheers!
