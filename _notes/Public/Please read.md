Read a lot. Then when you’re tired, read some more. Read things you agree with and read things you don’t. [Sit with that discomfort - discomfort leads to growth](https://x.com/gyanl/status/1495658007128309763?s=61). 

Read books on our justice system - its successes and failures. Read Anita Gets Bail by Arun Shourie and also read The Colonial Constitution by Arghya Sengupta. Read To Kill a Mockingbird. Read Zia Mody’s book and read Madhav Khosla and Gautam Bhatia. 

If you must, watch some movies. Watch Twelve Angry Men and watch Gangajal. That cuts a fairly vast swathe across what you can expect to find in the profession. 

If I can be slightly selfish, please also read the financial papers - Mint is a good one. Read The Morning Context. Subscribe to Money Stuff. Maybe read Barbarians at the Gate and The Smartest Guys in the Room? 

> If you don’t like reading, why are you in law school?
