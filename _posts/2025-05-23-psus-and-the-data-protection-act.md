<p> while the digital personal data protection act, 2023 was enacted by the indian parliament in august 2023, it has not yet been brought into force by the government of india. </p>

<p> a number of obligations under the act are linked to and/or intended to be detailed further in rules that the government is empowered to issue. in this context, the government has issued the draft digital personal data protection rules, 2025 - these are intended to provide a framework for operationalising the act. however, the rules remain in draft form. </p>

<p> subject to the exemptions set out below, the main obligations of data fiduciaries (entities that utilise personal data for anything) under the act are: <br>
(i) obtaining the data principal's (the owner of the data's) consent for processing the data principal's personal data, either directly or through a "consent manager" appointed by the data fiduciary for this purpose at the data fiduciary's discretion; <br>
(ii) ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data principal's personal data (data which makes an individual identifiable - data itself is so broadly defined in the act that it can mean anything, which i suppose is the point); <br>
(iii) providing, on request by the data principal: <br>
	(a) a summary of the personal data being processed by the data fiduciary; <br>
	(b) details of the processing activities; and <br>
	(c) the identities of all other data fiduciaries and data processors (third parties voluntarily appointed by a data fiduciary to process data on the fiduciary's behalf) with whom such data has been shared; <br>
(iv) updating any inaccurate or incomplete personal data on request by the data principal; <br>
(v) erasing, and causing any data processors appointed by the data fiduciary to erase, the data principal's personal data on withdrawal of the consent mentioned in (i) above; <br>
(vi) notifying the data protection board, a regulatory body constituted under the act, and the affected data principal of a data breach; and <br>
(vii) establishing a grievance redressal mechanism. </p>

<p> additionally, if the data principal is a child or a person with disability, data fiduciaries: <br>
(i) must seek the lawful guardian's consent prior to processing the data principal's personal data; <br>
(ii) cannot undertake any processing of personal data that is "likely to cause any detrimental effect on the well-being of a child"; and <br>
(iii) cannot undertake tracking or behavioural monitoring of children. </p>

<p> the act provides for the following exemptions: <br>
(i) an exemption from all obligations set out above in case personal data is processed: <br>
      (a) for enforcing a legal right or claim; <br>
      (b) by a court, tribunal, judicial or quasi-judicial body; <br>
      (c) pursuant to an approved m&a scheme; or <br>
      (d) in connection to a payment default; <br>
(ii) an exemption from the consent, accuracy, disclosure and erasure requirements mentioned above for certain data fiduciaries that the government may notify, having regard to the volume and nature of personal data being processed by them, including startups; <br>
(iii) an exemption from the obligation to erase personal data if such data is processed by the state or any of its instrumentalities; and <br>
(iv) an exemption from any provision of the act for any data fiduciary that the government may notify within five years of the statute being brought into effect. </p>

<p> the act also allows the government to: <br>
(i) exempt certain data fiduciaries; and/or <br>
(ii) notify an age above which data fiduciaries will be exempt, <br>
from (i) and (iii) of the special provisions for children and persons with disabilities. <br>
in this context, the rules specifically exempt healthcare establishments and educational institutions from these obligations. </p>

<p> lastly, the act also provides for blanket exemptions when data is processed: <br>
(i) by such instrumentality of the state as the government may notify in the interests of: <br>
(a) the sovereignty and integrity of india; <br>
(b) security of the state; <br>
(c) friendly relations with foreign states; or <br>
(d) maintenance of public order; and <br>
(ii) for research, archival or statistical purposes. </p>

<p> i see no blanket exemptions under the act for state instrumentalities delivering infrastructure services. while broad, the grounds set out for blanket exemptions above lie in well-defined contours. as such, it becomes difficult to say that state utilities, in and of themselves, qualify for these exemptions. </p>

<p> as a matter of fact, the act expressly treats processing of personal data by the state (or any of its instrumentalities) for public service delivery as a legitimate use case requiring conformity to standards prescribed by the rules. given this, it becomes even harder to argue that public utility companies stand carved-out from the ambit of the act. </p>

<p> that being said, and while there is no definitive guidance either way, state utilities can potentially avail of the limited exemption from the erasure requirement that is available to all state instrumentalities. </p>

<p> i suppose the government could theoretically notify these companies as eligible for a generic broader exemption. the current iteration of the rules is silent on who the intended beneficiaries of such exemptions are likely to be. in any case, i would expect ppp agreements executed within the first five years of the act coming into effect to clarify whether service providers are expected to comply with all statutory data protection obligations, notwithstanding the availability of potential exemptions. </p>
