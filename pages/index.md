## About

Hi! I'm Pranav, a corporate lawyer specialising in renewable energy and social infrastructure. 

I currently work as a PPP consultant at the [World Bank Group](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/country/india). Before this, I was at Trilegal for five years. You can access a copy of my resume here.
